# FileSearch
Crawls samba servers on a local network, and adds everything found into MySQL database.
Can be used later for analysis or searches. 
It was supposed to be a part of a file-sharing search engine for a local network I once worked for. 

_An experimental hobby project to crawl the Samba resources on the local network, Mar 2005._

_Uploaded to GitHub in 2011 for historical purposes._
